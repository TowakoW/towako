# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
# c:/Users/towa/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2
# python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
# rm will remove the file.

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add - adds to remote directory

# no particular questions, just bewildered.
# I now edit this, the terminal output is...messed up. works fine if i specifically run 
# the code below, but shows a syntax error for '&' when run normally. makes me angry.
# in the process of trying to use the vscode built in ai to fix.
# not quite sure what I did but hope it's legible...runs if i use "python run and debug" but will not run normaly on python output.
